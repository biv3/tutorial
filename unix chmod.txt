example-

Deny execute permission to everyone.

$ chmod a-x sample.txt 
Allow read permission to everyone.

1. Add single permission to a file/directory
Changing permission to a single set. + symbol means adding permission. For example, do the following to give execute permission for the user irrespective of anything else:

$ chmod u+x filename
2. Add multiple permission to a file/directory
Use comma to separate the multiple permission sets as shown below.

$ chmod u+r,g+x filename
3. Remove permission from a file/directory
Following example removes read and write permission for the user.

$ chmod u-rx filename
4. Change permission for all roles on a file/directory
Following example assigns execute privilege to user, group and others (basically anybody can execute this file).

$ chmod a+x filename
5. Make permission for a file same as another file (using reference)
If you want to change a file permission same as another file, use the reference option as shown below. In this example, file2’s permission will be set exactly same as file1’s permission.

$ chmod --reference=file1 file2
6. Apply the permission to all the files under a directory recursively
Use option -R to change the permission recursively as shown below.

$ chmod -R 755 directory-name/
7. Change execute permission only on the directories (files are not affected)
On a particular directory if you have multiple sub-directories and files, the following command will assign execute permission only to all the sub-directories in the current directory (not the files in the current directory).

$ chmod u+X *



$ chmod a+r sample.txt 
Make a file readable and writable by the group and others.

$ chmod go+rw sample.txt 
Make a shell script executable by the user/owner.

$ chmod u+x samplescript.sh
Allow everyone to read, write, and execute the file and turn on the set group-ID.

$ chmod =rwx,g+s samplescript.sh
